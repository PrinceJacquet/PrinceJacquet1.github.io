### My name is Prince Jacquet  ...  <br>  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; and This is My Personal Website !


## Technical interests

My person is 70 to 80% composed of interest in electronics, so there is much of it here. <br>

See how fun and important electronic engineering is to me  [My projetcs](https://princejacquet.github.io/projects/) and how I apply it at World Record Holder Team : [TIM UPS-INSA](http://www.timupsinsa.com/)



## Other stuff I enjoy

But I also present other things that I am proud of on this website.


My learning experiences in sports (basketball, ping pong ...), My way of helping student with difficulties ...

Why I love eating ? How I become the best at embedded Programming ?

Some may says that's too ambitious ... Yes, but it's fun !!

Comme along, and see (if*) **When** I MAKE it ^^
