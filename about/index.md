My name is Prince Jacquet  ...  <br>  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; and This is My Personal Website !<center>

My person is 70 to 80% composed of interest in electronics, so there is much of it here.
But I also present other things that I am proud of on this website.
