<p>A block diagram:

<p>The PCB was designed and routed in KiCad (git version from 2015), but I had a few issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>I forgot to retrigger the zone fills after moving 3 vias, that caused a direct short between the VCC and GND layers</li>
<li>I accidentally specified the mounting holes as plated in the gerbers and got a nice fat short between the VCC and GND layers, again</li>
<li>I got the VCC (3.3V) regulator footprint mirrored, so I got to solder the component dead-bug style</li>
<li>And I ordered the wrong regulator (4.5V instead of 3.3V) on Digikey, and fried 3 of my expensive FM transmitter chips because of that</li>
<li>I had gotten a fancy PMIC (which turns out wasn&rsquo;t needed after all) and it wouldn&rsquo;t power my board no matter what</li>
</ol>
<p>All avoidable errors, and from now on, I&rsquo;m putting 0-ohms after all regulators so I can test them before powering the whole board. Also I think KiCad now auto-triggers zone fills before gerber exports.</p>
<p>Fixes:<br>
1. Drilled through the vias and connected the tracks with enamel wire<br>
2. Removed just the plated ring on top and bottom with a cone dremel bit<br>
3. (and 4): I had a 3.3V linear regulator lying around, so a bit of glue and loose wiring made it work<br>
5. After re-reading the datasheet I soldered a 10k resistor, and bridged a pin and the board powered up</p>
<h2 id="body">Body</h2>
<p>I used Solidworks to model the body for the pcb. I printed the body and buttons at my university <a href="https://fablab.univ-tlse3.fr/wiki/index.php/Accueil">makerspace</a> on a makerbot printer.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a good kicad-solidworks workflow back then, so in summary, I took the pcb&rsquo;s dimensions and mouting hole locations with a caliper and modeled only the pcb (no components) in solidworks and modeled the case around it. The case printed right-ish the first time (a bit of warping on the top), it was printed in white PLA.</p>
<p>For the buttons, I did a little adding and subtracting of the case height, tactile switch height and FR4 width and with a little trial and error (and cursing at the printer&rsquo;s not-so-consistent tolerance) managed to print it right after only 4 times (yay!).</p>
<p>For fitting the 1/4in jack I first soldered the signal wires, then heated up the hole in the PLA (~100°C) and force-screwed it in, warping it a little bit, but now it&rsquo;s firmly attached.</p>

<h2 id="pcb">PCB</h2>
<p>The pcb was laid out in an older kicad version, and since the <a href="https://www.elecrow.com/pcb-manufacturing.html">fab house</a> didn&rsquo;t make me pay for silkscreening the back, I added a nice guitar decal :D<br>
The schematic has older kicad symbols so ther will be import issues with KiCad 5, but nothing too terrible.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised with KiCad v4&rsquo;s usability/stability improvements, and decided to use KiCad for all future projects (I previously used Eagle, and tried Proteus too).<br>
I really enjoyed using my mouse, a razer <a href="https://support.razer.com/gaming-mice-and-mats/razer-naga/">Naga 2014</a>, with all the button mapped to actions (e.g. place via, switch layer, start trace, enter, delete, move). I modified a script I found online (don&rsquo;t remember where), but anyway <a href="naga.sh">here it is</a>.</p>
<p><img src="img/gfm_pcbnew.png" alt="guitarfm layout" class="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" /></p>
<p>I had a few design &amp; layout mistakes, as explained earlier, in the two pictures below, you can see that I changed the preamp circuit: the op-amp had a too large gain value, so converted it to a two-stage preamp.<br>
I also had problems with the two clamping diodes filtering the signal (I put leds to get a bigger Vf), so had to remove them.<br>
The limiter and distortion circuits seem to work at least, so I have that going for me which is nice.</p>
<p>As the LDR+diode module was not available on Digikey, I forgot to buy it and so I had to set the gain with a resistor in a pinch. and then I forgot about it, so that part of the circuit isn&rsquo;t tested either.</p>
<p>You can also see the antenna wire sticking out of the case, as I didn&rsquo;t take the time to put it back nicely in the case each time.</p>

<p><img src="img/gfm_pcb_on.jpg" alt="guitarfm pcb" class="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" /></p>
<p>Reflow time !<br>
I ordered a stencil along the PCBs, and applied paste with my uni card. Then, I placed the components one by one with tweezers.</p>
<p>Then, the real fun: I put the board on an old pan, and used my parents&rsquo; gas cooktop to reflow the board, adjusting power while checking the temp with a cheap IR gun.</p>
<p><img src="img/gfm_reflow.jpg" alt="high-tech reflow process" class="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" /></p>
<p>After a few touch-ups with the iron, and fixing the previous design issues, the board powered up !</p>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>The whole thing is programmed with Arduino and I&rsquo;m using Adafruit&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Si4713-Library">Si4713 library</a> to control the FM TX.
I modified the library to enable AGC though.</p>
<p>Using the interface, one can change the frequency, enable/disable diode distortion, adjust input gain, and save the current settings to flash.</p>
<p><a href="gfm_code_20160102.zip">Arduino project ZIP</a> and <a href="arduino_libs.zip">Library folder</a></p>
<p>The program is a simple polling/refresh loop, I didn&rsquo;t bother using interrupts or put the uC to sleep.<br>
I did one thing to get better battery life though: After a timeout, there is a &ldquo;screensaver&rdquo; function, a simple one-led-at-a-time animation so I don&rsquo;t drain the battery leaving the display on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll add a video to this page eventually, when I get my hands on an FM radio.</p>
<h2 id="previous-revisions">Previous revisions</h2>
<p>The v2 was made in Eagle v6 light and was 100x100mm with a trace antenna.<br>
It had a bit more noise than the v2, a bit due to me putting the PSU right next to the signal trace, I didn&rsquo;t know any better back then.<br>
I was learning how to solder smd by hand so the joints are a bit ugly, but good enough.<br>
This version used a rotary encoder for the interface</p>
<p>A few pictures:</p>

<h2 id="project-future">Project future</h2>
<p>I initially wanted to sell these, so a redesign was planned, but let&rsquo;s be honest, who has an FM radio at home anymore ?</p>
<p>Anyway, if I do revisit this project, I have a few upgrades planned:</p>
<ul>
<li>A better input stage</li>
<li>Integrate an <a href="http://www.spinsemi.com/products.html">FV1 chip</a> from spinsemi for distortion &amp; reverb</li>
<li>A battery gauge</li>
</ul>
